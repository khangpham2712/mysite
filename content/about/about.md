            I live in HCMC and I am a student of Bach Khoa University, who is currently majoring in computer science. In 2018, I got admitted to Bach Khoa University via national exam. That was my first step into the world of IT which I have always been desiring.

            Before that, in high school, Math was my forte. I felt like I had good problem solving and analytical thinking skills. I could spend hours trying to solve a single problem in many different ways and by doing that, my skills escalated drastically.

        I have done some small projects at university such as simple P.O.S system, simple e-commerce website and simple games. Speaking of P.O.S system and e-commerce website, I was entrusted with a functionality branch. I drew use-case diagram, sequence diagram, and code some api functions to perform functionalities. In terms of games, I used Python (pygame) to implement them.
